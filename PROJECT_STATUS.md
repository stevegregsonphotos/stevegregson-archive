# Steve Gregson Archive — Project Status (handover)

Last updated: 14 October 2026, 22:10 (London)

This is the short handover a new chat should read first. Keep it short:
it is read at the start of every chat, so length costs usage. Older, longer
versions are in git history; deep background is in PROJECT-CONTEXT.md.

**Claude: update this file at the end of every job** (what changed, what's
live, what's waiting). Commit it with the job's own changes, so it doesn't
cost an extra Vercel build.

---

## How Steve works (always follow)

- Steve is a UK theatre photographer, not a developer. Plain English, no
  jargon, short reports.
- Website changes: push to the test branch `feature/backstage-transfers`
  first (Vercel preview). Only merge to the live branch `website-redesign`
  when Steve says **"go live"**. Always tell him when something is waiting
  for "go live".
- Minimise Vercel builds (batch changes).
- Any Google check: Google UK only.
- Never enter passwords, never put secrets in Vercel's secret store, never
  paste keys in chat. No paid services/accounts (no Apple Developer).
- Never spend on the OpenAI API without Steve's approval for that run.
- Stage files explicitly; never reset/clean/stash Steve's working tree.
- Big file copies on his Mac: give Steve a Terminal command to run himself
  rather than looping copy steps from Claude (saves usage; Claude's
  background processes on the Mac stop when each command ends).
- Copying from Dropbox into Storage needs free space for BOTH copies until
  the Mac app uploads and offloads — check free space first.

## Repo, branches, checks

- GitHub: `stevegregsonphotos/stevegregson-archive`. Live branch
  `website-redesign` (Vercel production). Test branch
  `feature/backstage-transfers`. Live is fast-forwarded from the test work:
  `git push origin HEAD:website-redesign` once Steve says go live.
- Next.js 16 App Router (`proxy.ts`, see AGENTS.md), Vercel Hobby, Neon
  Postgres, Cloudflare R2 (site images), Backblaze B2 (Storage/Transfers,
  bucket `stevegregson-client-archive`), Resend email, Cloudflare DNS.
- Before pushing: `npx tsc --noEmit`, eslint on changed files, and for
  bigger changes `OPENAI_API_KEY=x npx next build` ("DATABASE_URL not
  configured" at prerender is expected in the sandbox).
  Pre-existing lint errors: `CuratedArchiveImportClient.tsx` (setState in
  effect, lines ~703/791) — not ours.
- Steve's Mac copy of the repo is updated with `git pull` (easiest: open
  Curate Production, press Control+C, type `git pull`).
- Domains: www.stevegregson.com (site), transfers.stevegregson.com (client
  downloads/uploads), storage.stevegregson.com → Backstage Storage,
  stevegregsonphotos.com → 301 to www (keep it; DNS-only in Cloudflare).

## What's built (all live unless noted)

- **Storage** (Backstage › Storage): Dropbox-style file store on B2. Photo
  previews (640px thumbs), Deleted files (30 days), Share with client
  (live folder links, per-person activity), Request files (clients upload
  into `Received/`).
- **Transfers**: WeTransfer-style sending, progress in the Transfer
  button, personal links per recipient, "Who's downloaded", first-download
  email to Steve. There is no "sent" confirmation email (by design).
- **Mac app "Steve Gregson Storage"**: `~/Steve Gregson Storage` uploads
  automatically; copies (not moves) from Dropbox/Drive/iCloud; clears Mac
  copies after OFFLOAD_DAYS (config in `~/Library/Application Support/
  Steve Gregson Storage/config`); keeps top-level client folders; mirrors
  folders both ways; updates itself daily from the live site
  (`public/mac/agent.zsh`, `install.sh --update`).
- **Backstage sign-in**: Touch ID / Face ID passkeys, password sign-in
  switched off (Vercel `BACKSTAGE_ALLOW_PASSWORD=1` re-enables it).
- **Production curator** (`scripts/production-curator.mjs`, Mac app
  "Curate Production", output `~/Pictures/Curated/<Show>`):
  - Free route: prepares contact sheets → Steve asks Claude (Mac linked)
    to write `pass-2.json` + `metadata-research.json` per
    `CLAUDE-CURATION-BRIEF.md` → "Finish a Claude curation".
  - Paid route (OpenAI): approve with **y**.
  - Reads straight from Dropbox/Drive (stops only if a folder is >40 GB).
  - Takes venue + show + date from `Client / Show - Month Year / … / Web`
    however deep; "In Rehearsal" folders get that suffix.
- **Curated archive import** (Backstage › Curated import): uploads the
  curator output and publishes productions (reads each file before upload
  to avoid Safari "Load failed").

## Waiting / in progress

- **Faster Mac uploads — LIVE 14 Oct:** `agent.zsh` uploads 8 files at once
  (`UPLOAD_JOBS` in the Mac config, 1–32); `api/mac` presign records an
  identical-but-unconfirmed file instead of making a "(Mac)" duplicate;
  `install.sh --update` stops the old run first. Steve's Mac updated 10:18.
  Measured: ~10 MB/s (~80 Mbit/s, near his line) vs ~1.6 MB/s before.
- **MOUNTVIEW → Storage (2024–26 shows only, by design):** 33 of the 58
  Dropbox MOUNTVIEW folders (29,900 files, 307 GB). **UPLOAD COMPLETE
  14 Oct 17:42** — check at 18:25: all 29,900 files on the Mac have an
  "Uploaded" line (each confirmed by size + MD5 in Storage), 0 left, 0
  "(Mac)" duplicates; 20 temporary failures around 13:00 all retried OK.
  19:00: Steve set OFFLOAD_DAYS=0 — Mac clears each uploaded file after
  re-verifying (one at a time, ~1/s). By 22:05: 9,131 cleared, ~20k to go.
  PUT IT BACK (e.g. 7) once the MOUNTVIEW moves are done.
  19:30–22:08: rsync copied 9 to 5, Site Specific + most 2024 folders into
  `~/Steve Gregson Storage/MOUNTVIEW` — NOT YET UPLOADED (0 uploads since
  19:00) because the agent's clearing loop blocks new uploads until a run
  finishes. Free space fell to 62 GB (Dropbox keeps its downloads +
  the Storage copy). 22:08: Steve stopping all Terminals (copy +
  caffeinate); background uploader left running (only frees space).
  NEXT CHAT: check free space (`df -h ~`), log progress; uploads of the
  2023/24 folders start when the clearing run ends. Rerun the 2024 copy
  (rsync resumes) only when space allows; the ten 2021–22 folders need
  Dropbox Selective Sync first.
  **FIX NEEDED (agent.zsh):** offload loop must not block uploads (run an
  upload pass between offload chunks, or cap offload per run), and do
  offload verifies in parallel like uploads. Also: never give Steve a big
  copy command without checking it can't fill the disk.
- **Dropbox won't offload anything:** every "Make online-only" (MOUNTVIEW,
  Jermyn Street, even Twelfth Night alone) gives "Unable to Remove
  Download", even after restarting Dropbox. Files ARE online (checked).
  Suspect Dropbox account being full. Not urgent: macOS counts them as
  purgeable (Finder shows ~263 GB available vs ~48 GB truly free).
- **The Rink – May 2026 (GSA): ~890 photos exist ONLY on the Mac** —
  `Full New`, `Web New`, `Full Replacement`, `Web Replacement` never
  uploaded (Dropbox full). Not yet copied to Storage. Copy command:
  `mkdir -p ~/"Steve Gregson Storage"/"Guildford School of Acting" && cd ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/"Guildford School of Acting" && rsync -rt --exclude .DS_Store "The Rink - May 2026" ~/"Steve Gregson Storage"/"Guildford School of Acting"/`
  Young Frankenstein – June 2026 is also Mac-only in Dropbox but is safe
  in Google Drive ("Young Frankenstein - June 2026 copy").
- TODO: scan Dropbox for other files on the Mac that never uploaded
  (anything since ~May 2026 may be affected).
- Steve to check Stage Door Jonny (Jez Butterworth) in Productions: the
  import showed "Load failed" but the production exists.
- **Adding missing productions to the archive:** Steve has
  "Missing productions checklist.xlsx" (93 shows not on the site, from a
  Dropbox vs archive comparison on 13 Oct; biggest gaps Jermyn Street,
  Mill Hill School, City Academy, Mountview). Workflow: make the show's
  Dropbox folder available offline → curate → import → tick off → set
  back to online-only. Curated so far: David Copperfield (free route),
  Little Brother (paid route, first test). Stage Door Jonny imported.
- Mountview move checklist artifact:
  https://claude.ai/artifact/3KaMy6VmDJAe6GRjDx6Rmh. Steve keeps Dropbox
  for other clients.
- **Backblaze Computer Backup** (RAW drives, ~20 TB uploading, 1-year
  version history): still to exclude the `Steve Gregson Storage` folder.
- Scheduled tasks: yearly Backblaze drive check (1 Oct); put the Mac app
  back to 7-day offload on 13 Nov 2026.

## Ideas not started

- Optional "transfer sent" confirmation email to Steve (he said no need).
